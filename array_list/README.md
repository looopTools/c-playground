# Array List 

In this playground I play with the concept of dynamical array lists which increase in size as it is needed. 
I use it to illustrate how easily C can be used to code memory safe code, if you follow a few object oriented programming princpals in your code when working with `struct`s.

In addition I show case how the safety of C can be improved by using `perror` and `assert`.
